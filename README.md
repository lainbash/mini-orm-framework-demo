# mini-orm-framework-demo
a simple demo of a lightweight ORM framework for PHP with MySQL

Use a simple and vague DAO capable of handling basic CRUD operation.
you need to create classes reflecting your SQL table with personalized methods that use the DAO ones as a base.
Use function.php to validate, sanitize and securise inputs as well as outputs

- import the test.sql database
- use login.php and signin.php to test it
